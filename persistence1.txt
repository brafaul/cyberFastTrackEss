Persistence:
	Attacker's main goal at this stage is to maintain their connection over a longer period of time
	In a penetration test we don't usually attempt persistence
	IoCs: Indicators of Comprise are artefacts left behind on a computer by an attacker
	Detecting persistence methods is one of the best ways to spot a compromised system
	Simple listener that starts when a computer does and waits for an attacker to connect is persistence
	On linux netstat can be used to search for listening ports using:
		netstat -pultn
	Can use lsof to list all the files open by the process:
		lsof -p 7813
	More creative persistence possibilities:
		1. Open the port only at a certain time every day for a certain duration
		2. Make a DNS request to a certain domain, and if the domain resolves to a specific IP address, open the port
		3. If the target is a web server, change the php to start the listener when a specific request is sent to a page
		4. Replace detection commands with custom binaries that do not show malware
	Also use netstat on windows to find open ports with:
		netstat -a -b -o
	Can use process explorer from Microsoft sysinternals to find more info on a process

Start-up items:
	One of the most basic mechanisms for persistence is having malware execute on start-up
	On Linux there are several methods to start software at boot
	Runlevel specifies which mode the operating system is running under:
		-0(shutdown)
		-1(single-user mode[kind of like safe mode])
		-2 through 5(multi-user / normal modes)
		-6(reboot)
	Can find current runlevel using runlevel command
	Can find all the software that is configured to run at runlevelx in 'etc/rcX.d/'
	On some systems the '/etc/rc.local' file can be edited to have software start at boot
	Another method of starting processes at startup in Linux is to use systemd(if it is installed)
	Can view a list of installed services using systemctl
	Service files are usually located at either:
		/lib/systemd/system/*.service
		/etc/systemd/system/*.service
	On Windows, the simplest way of getting malware to launch on startup is to put it in a user's startup items folder
		C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
		C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp
	Registry can also be used to launch programs at startup
	Great way to view these items is the use the 'Autoruns' program from Micrsoft Sysinternals

Shortcuts:
	On Windows, shortcuts can be hijacked to run code when a user is interacting with the system
	Could edit an existing shortcut to run malware when clocked

Rootkits:
	A form of malware designed to allow an attacker back into a system at a later date, while hiding their presence
	Two types of rootkits: 'usermode' and 'kernelmode'
	usermode runs as a user in the system, not dissimilar to meterpreter and other types of malware we've been using so far
		Hides its presence by replacing system binaries with custom versions which report all the right information except for information that would comprise the rootkit's presence
	kernelmode rootkit lives in the kernel and can change the result of kernel calls
	Things to watch out for:
		1. Your settings keep changing without user interaction
		2. Your input devices keep disconnecting and reconnecting
		3. Your anti-malware software stops running and cannot be started again
		4. Network traffic coming from the computer shows traffic on certain ports, but the computer in question reports those ports are closed
	If malware can run at high enough privilege level, it can write directly to the disk without having to use the file system as an intermediary
	Some bootkits can even survive after the disk has been wiped and re-partitioned by persisting in the firmware of the hard disk itself
	Best bet to get rid of rootkit is to wipe and re-parition the drive, and install a fresh OS on it
	Are ways of clearing up an infection but they are not recommended
		1.Linux: rootkit hunter (rkhunter)
		2. On windows many anti-malware suites have rootkit scanners downloadble seperatly
		3. On Windows you can find rootkit scanners such as GMER

Word Templates and Add-ins:
	Replace the template file with one containing macro-based malware, then the malware will run each and every time the user opens Word, or any document that they save from then on
	Few downsides:
		1. The target must have macro warnings disabled
		2. Anyone the target sends dicuments to could have macro warnings enabled and may alert them to a breach
	Often used by worms to keep spreading, rather than to maintain a presence on the network because it is so detectable
	Word allows for third parties to write add-ins which extend the functionality of Microsoft Word
		%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Word\StartUp\
	Uses a custom format called a '.wll' file, which can host executable code, essentially a dll

Yara:
	Signature detection tool which has become the gold standard for detecting indicators of compromise
	Works by scanning a system and comparing the results with rules in its database, then flags the user as a possible indicator of comprise if any are found
	Anyone can write rules for it quickly and easily
	Can indentify common patterns such as registry keys generated or files written to the diskand tehn create rules to automate the process of finding the extent of an intrusion accross all the computers on your network
