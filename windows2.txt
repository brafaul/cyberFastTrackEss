User Accounts:
	Default acounts are always created when you install windows:
		Administrator: Full control over machine, somethings it can't do, can be used to manage other users and install applications
		Guest: Used by those that don't have an account on the computer, limited in what it can do
		Default	Account: Used as a template for all new accounts
	Account Types:
		Windows has three account types Administrator, Standard, and Child
		lusrmgr.mc can be used to create new users

Groups:
	Windows comes with several groups already built in
		Administrators: Can change things that affect all users
		Users: Default group most new users will be assigned to, can not install new software or make similar changes
		Remote Desktop Users: These user can connect to the computer remotely
		Guests: Do not have permanent profile on the machine

User Account Control:
	Works by assingning tokens whenever a user signs in
	All users are given a standard token which is used to run applications with a limited level of access
	When a admin wants to make changes to the system an administrative token is released and used to run the application with all the powers that come from being an admin
		These tokens are valid for as long as the application is running
	There are four UAC options:
		Always Notify: Prompt is always shown when apps try to install software or make changes tot computer and when you try to change windows settings
		Notify me only when apps try to make changes to my computer:
		Same as above without desktop dimming:
		Never Notify:

File Permissions:
	Each file or folder has an Access Control List(ACL) which stores who is allowed which level of access
	Access this list through properties then head to the security tab
	All permissions can be allowed or denied, and a deny will always override an allow
	Default action when a user does not have access is to deny
	Files have the following permissions
		Full Control
		Modify: Read, write, modify, and execute the file
		Read and Execute: Allows you to see the files contents and execute it
		Read: Allows you to see the files contents
		Write: Allows you to write data to the file
	Folders adds:
		List Folder Contents: Display folder's contents, the contents of files inside, and run any programs in the folder

Hidden Files:
	When we hide a file, the hidden attribute is added
	Can see hidden files under the View tab in Explorer settings
