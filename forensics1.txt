Forensics:
	Process of preserving and evaluating electronic data, in order to reconstruct prior events
	Goal is to acquire an accurate representation of the data on a target system and then eveluate it for clues, in order to find out what happened
	First step in any forensic investigation is to decide on priorities

Evidence:
	If evidence is to hold up in court, there are several steps that analyst must take
	Must take notes throughout the investigation in a notebook
		-Notebook must not be ring bound
		-Should be clearly dated with the name of the analyst on it
	Everything written in the notebook is evidence

Chain of Custody:
	All physical evidence collected during the investigation must go into sealable evidence bags, which the analyst must name and date
	Must also name and date the evidence bag when the evidence is tranfered from person to person
	Forensic captures of all evidence should be made before they are sealed

Steganography:
	Is the practice of concealing data within other data
	First recorded use back to 440BC by the Greek historian Histiaeus
	At the most basic level, you could open another file, and hide a secret message inside of it
	Has been widely used for centuries EX: Microdots
	More modern usage of steganography includes concealing messages within the lowest bits of images, concealing data within encrypted or random data and embedding hidden messages in image files
	Detection of steganography can be difficult, requires careful physical examination and is often a time-consuming process
	Steganalysis is the term used to represent the simplest method of detecting modified files
	Stegware is also a term being used currently t represent the hiding of cyber-attacks, making detection an inadequate defence
	Audio steganography is a technique used to embed secret messages into digital audio, works by modifying audio signal in an imperceptible manner
	Several methods of audio steganography including:
		-LSB(Least Significant Bit) us an algorithim used in conjunction with staganographic techniques for embedding text into images and also into audio
		-Echo Hiding is very popular within audio steganography, mainly for their robustness in compression, imperceptibility and similarity to LSB their capacity
	Many steganography tools available today:
		Crypture: Command line tool that performs steganography
		Binwalk: A tool for searching a given binary image for embedded files and executable code
		Steghide: An open source steganography software that lets you hide your secret file inside an image or audio file, without any noticable change in the file
		rSteg: A Java based tool that lets you hide textual data inside an image
		OpenStego: Tool that allows you to attach any kind of secret message file an image file
	Steghide is one the most common and easiest to use tools, it can both hide and extract data in various kinds of file types
	Useful commands in Steghide:
		info, --info - Displays information about a cover or stego file
		-ef, --embedfile <filename> - Specify the file that will be embedded (the file that contains the secret message)
		-cf, --coverfile <filename> - Specify the cover file that will be used to embed data
		-sf, --stegofile <filename> - Specify the stego file (file that contains embedded data)
		-xf, --extractfile <filename> - Create a file with the name <filename> and write the data that is embedded in the stego file to it

Event logs and Log files:
	Log file analysis is another major part of being a forensic analyst
	Often a multi-stage process of looking up various code and looking at the registry and file system to determine what the identifiers mean
	Can view log files using the Windows Event Log Viewer
	The Event Viewer has Windows event log hierachy, which contains many categories, the main categories are:
		-Application
		-Security
		-System
	Logs contain detailed information, such as important hardware and software actions and different types of logins
	Each event log contains date/time information, usernames and computer IDs, and source and type information
	Logs also include an Event ID, which specifies the event type
		Ex: ID of 4624 is a successful login event
	Most important thing to consider when looking at log files is the time zone, convert them all to UTC format across the entirety of your report

File Integrity and Hashes:
	File integrity allows us to identify if any unauthorised changes have been made to the file and allows us to prove that a file has not been changed
	Hashing is a method used to determine whether a file has been altered, by creating and comparing cryptographic keys
	Most Common hash is known as "Message Digest Version 5" or "MD5"
	MD5: A unique 128-bit value generated by a hash algorithim and is represented by a 32-hexadecimal digit
	SHA-256: Uses 256-bits, increasing the different letter/number combinations that can be generated

Incident Response:
	Often the first line of defence in most organisations
	They respond to and identify threats quickly in order to ultimately minimise the effect of the attack, conatain the damage, and identify and remediate the root cause of the incident; whereas forensic analysis traditionally happen post incident
	Six stages of incident response and incident handling:
	1.Preparation: Aim of this stage is to prepare the business, as well as the incident repsonders/handlers that are on hand to tackle incidents
		It is important to focus on people, policy, communications and most importantly documentation
	2.Identification: Concetrate on identifying the scope of the incident: how many machines have been infected, do we have a patient zero?
		Typically use this stage for analysing logs and security events
	3.Containment: Stops the atacker from progressing any deeper into the target systems, can involve changing permissions on critical systems and seperating the infected machines from the rest of the network
	4.Eradication: This stage is about applying patches,closing back doors, disabling accounts and ultimately kicking the attacker out of your systems
		Important to pause and allow time for the monitoring team to see if the attacker has re-enterd the enviroment
	5.Recovery: Focused on returning the systems to full production specifications. Includes more widespread actions, such as mass password reset for every account on the network and pushing out all patches
	6.Lessons Learned: Business as a whole needs to review the entire attack from start to finish
