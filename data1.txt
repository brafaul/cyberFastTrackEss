Bit:
	The smallest unit of data that can be stored on a computer system
	Stored as a boolean value
	A byte is 8 bits
	1 kilobyte(kB) is 1000 bytes
	1 kibibytes(KiB) is 1024 bytes
Alternate Number Bases:
	Table headerings are factors of whatever base the system is
	Binary is a base 2 system
		-Often converted to base 16(hexadecimal) to make number shorter
	Notation is used to specify what base a number is in
		-0d is denary
		-0b is binary
		-0x is hexadecimal

Binary:
	Kenw this

Hexadecimal:
	Base 16

ASCII:
	American Standard Code for Information Interchange
	Orginal ASCII was 7 bits wide and supported 127 characters
	Extended ASCII is 8 bits and supports 255 characters
	Unicode supports a much larger character set so languages that don't use the latin alphabet can be supported

File Headers:
	Most files type have a header at the beginning of the file that tells us what kind or file it is
	Often more accurate than looking at the file extension
	Often called 'magic numbers', 'magic bytes', and 'file signatures'
	Plain text files don't have headers
