What is Virtualisation?:
	Where we create a virtual computer out of software that behaves like a seperate computer
	All hardware components of this computer are actually software
Operating System that runs the virtualisation software is called the host operating system
	The operating system that runs inside the virtual machine is called the guest operating system
	Guest operating system cannot directly access resources from the host

Types of Virtualisation:
	Hypervisor: layer of code that allows multiple operating systems to share the same hardware resources
	Type 2 Hypervisor: virtualisation is done by software that runs on an operating system EX: VMWare Workstation and Virtualbox
	Type 1 Hypervisor: virtualisation occurs at the firmware level, the virtualisation software is essentially the host operating system EX: VMWare vSphere and Proxmox

Uses of Virtualisation:
	Cloud uses Type 1 hypervisors
