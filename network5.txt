DNS:
	Domain Name System
	Responsible for translating a domain name into an IP address
	Every computer must a have DNS server configured in their network settings
	Router can use DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) to tell every computer to use a certain DNS server

TLD:
	DNS system is hierachical
	System relies on one server giving info on the next DNS server to query
	Top Level Domain is the end of the domain, such as .com
	Authoritative Name Server control the mapping between domain name and ip address
	Server can cache the mapping for domain name and ip address, periodically clears cache in case the mapping is updated

Foward & Reverse Lookups:
	Most common usage of DNS lookup is foward lookup, translating a domain name into an IP address
	Reverse lookup, translating an IP address into a domain name
	No authoritative name servers for IP addresses
	Get around by converting IP into domain name format 1.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa(reverse address of 192.168.0.1)

Recursive and Iterative Lookups:
	DNS is a hierarchical protocol, almost never get answer you are looking for on the first query
	Resursive Lookup, you ask a DNS server a question and if it doesn't know, it will ask another DNS server until it has an answer
	Internet standards today call for iterative lookups
	Iterative Lookup, you ask a DNS server a questio and it doesn't know, it will respond with the IP address of a DNS server that doesn't know, places more burden on the host asking the question

DNS Records:
	When you configure the authoritative DNS server for a particular domain, you will need to add DNS records for that domain
	A Record: Address Mapping record. Key record that maps a domain name to an IPv4 address
	AAAA Record: IPv6 Address Mapping record, equivalent of A record for IPv6
	CNAME Record: 'Canonical Name' record is used to create an alias of a domain name
	MX Record: Mail exchange record specifies the mail server responsible for handling email for that domain
	NS Record: Name Server record points to the authoritative name server for the domain in question
	PTR Record: Pointer record is used for reverse DNS lookups
	TXT Record: used for storing any other textual data associated with the domain name, used a lot for SPF and DKIM for mail servers
