Command Injection:
	A command injection flaw in a web application takes advantage of the manner in which web applications process user input and pass it to the command line to perform a task
	Can put multiple commands on one line using an ';' between commands
		Can also use '&&' or '||'
	Can also use '"' marks to close out things like echo "<input here>";
	Can prevent by using the application to do the work using the command line
	If this is not an option, then you need to sanitise user input
		Best to research a third party library to do the job of sanitising input

File Inclusion:
	Comes as a result of including resources on a page based on user input, in a way that the included file is executed by the web application
