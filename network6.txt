ICMP:
	Internet Control Message Protocol: protocol designed to transmit error messages and operational info between hosts on a network
	Doesn't communicate data and isn't typically used in end-user applications
	For the most part, used exclusively by network devices
	Each packet consists of a type and a code, together they describe the packet's purpose

DHCP:
	Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, allows a DHCP server present on the network to assign network configuration setttings to each host automatically when they join the network
	Only one DHCP server should be used on any network
	Not uncommon for DHCP to be configured with static IP addresses for specific devices

OSI Model:
	Open Systems Interconnection is a way of describing the way computers communicate with each other over a network
	Theoretical model, so not all protocols will fit neatly into the seven layers
	Seven Layers are:
		-Layer 7-Application
		-Layer 6-Presentation
		-Layer 5-Session
		-Layer 4-Transport
		-Layer 3-Network
		-Layer 2-Data Link
		-Layer 1-Physical
	You start at the top and work your way down, each layer transforms the data until the physical layer the data is converted to electrical signals
	The Computer recieving the signals starts at the bottom and works its way up the model
	Application Layer: EX: HTTP or FTP
	Presentation Layer: EX:XML or JSON, deals with formatting data in a way that the intended recipient can understand. Encryption also happens in the presentation layer
	Session Layer: Handles opening, closing, and managing connections between computers
	Transport Layer: Responsible for end-to-end connections between computers on a network EX: TCP and UDP
	Network Layer: Responsible for routing the packet over the internet EX: IP
	Data Link Layer: Responsible for encoding and decoding packets into bits
	Physical Layer: Responsible for converting the packets into electrical signals

TCP/IP Model:
	Another theoretical model, only has four layers
		-Layer 4-Application
		-Layer 3-Transport
		-Layer 2-Internet
		-Layer 1-Network Access
	Application Layer: Same as OSI, but also includes presention and session layer EX: HTTP and FTP
	Transport Layer: Same as OSI
	Internet Layer: Same as OSI
	Network Access Layer: Combo of data link and physical layers from OSI model

Packet Headers:
	Process of encapsulation starts with application level data, and occurs by adding headers to the data
	HTTP/1.1 GET /, is a request for the index page of a site made by a browser
	First thing that happns is a TCP header is added to the data
	A TCP header consists of a source port, a destination port, a sequence number, and acknowledgement number and anything else the TCP protocol implements
	Next stage is to add the IP header, consists of info such as the version, source IP address, the destination IP address, the size of the packet and anything else the IP protocol implements
	Next stage is to add teh data link layer protocol(Ethernet in this example) Ethernet frame consists of header and footer, contains of the source MAC address, destination MAC address and anything else the Ethernet protocol implements 
	Finally the packet is converted to eletrical impulses
	On receiving end, it happens in the reverse

ARP:
	Address Resolution Protocol: Allows source computer to discover the MAC address of destination computer
	Only for local netowrk
