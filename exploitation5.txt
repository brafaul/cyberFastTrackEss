Social Engineering:
	Technical term for tricking someone into performing an action which is against their best interest
	Pretexting:
		One of the earliest forms of social engineering
		When you call or email the target and present yourself as someone else
		Difficult to pull off; requires skill and a high level of information gathering on the target
		Many easier forms of social engineering attack available

Phising:
	You craft an email which encourages people to click on a malicious link or execute a malicious file and send the email out in the hope that someone will fall for it
	Spear Phising: More targeted, crafted with a specific target in mind, and is therefore much more believable
	Generally there are at least three departments that are good targets: the legal department, the human resource department, and the accounting deparment
		-Their jobs involve accepting documents from sources outside of the company
	Word documents, along with some other file formats can be used to host malware
		-Microsoft documents on Windows support a feature called macros, which allow code to be executed when the document is opened
	PDFS are another good attack vector, can embed an executable file into a PDF and have an icon in the PDF which runs the program when a user clicks on it

Drive-by Download:
	Where an attacker compromises a site that their target visits often and installs malware which takes advantage of security holes in the target's browser to compromise them when they visit

Credential Harvesting:
	Relies on an attacker cloning a site and hosting it, then tricking a user into visiting it and entering login details

CEO Fraud:
	Type of spear phising attack, but some people call it 'whaling' to indicate the target is huge
	Idea is that the attacker will monitor the company they are targeting, possibly get into their email system and start reading their correspondence and schedules
