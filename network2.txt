IP Addresses:
	IPv4(Internet Protocol Version 4) are 4 bytes long, each period being one byte
		-2^32 possible addresses
	Network Address Translation(NAT) was designed as a way to delay the problem of running out of IPv4 addresses
		-Router is responsible for converting packets from public to private and vice versa
		-NAT accidentally works as a firewall by preventing people from connecting directly to your device 
	IPv6 addresses are 16 bytes long, two bytes per :
		-2^128 possible addresses
		-With IPv6 each computer would have its own address, so there would be no need for NAT

Subnets:
	A way of splitting a network into segments
	Often it on local networks inside larger organisations
	Always need at least one subnet, even if it spans the entire networ
	IP address is two parts, the network identifier adn host identifier
		-Network identifies the network, host identifies the individual computer
		-Both of these are variable so the subnet mask tells us how big each is
	A subnet mask of 255.255.0.0 means the first two bytes are the network identifier, and the rest is the host identifier
		-If you add more host, you can have fewer networks and vice vers
		-If you add more host, you can have fewer networks and vice versa
	CIDR is a shorthand way of writing subnet mask
		-192.168.0.0/16, means the network identifier is 16 bits
	In IPv4 there are certain addresses that are private and should never be routed to the internet
	In IPv6 ::1 is the local host or loopback address on IPv6
		-IPv4 subnets on IPv6 would not be pratical, would be bigger than entire IPv4 address range

TCP Protocol:
	Intial Connection setup is called the TCP handshake
		-Computer A sends 'SYN'(synchronise) flag to Computer B, that contains a sequence number
		- Computer B responds with a 'SYN' and 'ACK' flags set(synchronise/acknowledge), which contains a new sequence number and an acknowledgement number, which matches the sequence number sent by computer A, incremented by 1
		-Computer A respond with a packet with the 'ACK' flag, containing the sequence number sent by computer B, incremented by 1
	After this the conneciton is established
	In transmission the ACK number is incremented by the len of the packet
	When the connection ends, it is called the teardown
		-The computer that wants to end the connection sends a 'fin' packet, containing the current sequence number
			-ACK isn't needed to terminate the connection
		-Computer B responds with a ACK packet containing the sequence number and acknowledgement number, which is equal to A's sequence number incremented by 1
		-Computer B sends a 'fin/ack' packet containing a sequence number and an acknowledgement number, equal to the last one
		-Computer A respond with an 'ack' packet containing a acknowledgement number which is Computer B's sequence number incremented by 1
	If the connection cannot be torn down, one part can end it by sending an 'rst'(reset) packet, which ends the connection immediatly

UDP:
	Much simplier than TCP protocol, this makes UDP much faster than tcp

Protocols:
	HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) is used in browsing websites
		-Computer A sends a GET request, and sends some headers to give addtional information to the web server
		-Web server responds with a code 200 OK, meaning the file exist and can be displayed
		-Data in the file is sent
	FTP is used to transfer files
		-More like a back in forth conversation than http
		-Password is sent in clear text without encryption
