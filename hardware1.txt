Motherboard:
	Has slots other components slide into
	Different sizes:
		-E-ATX, stands for extented ATX
		-ATX, standard size
		-micro-ATX
		-mini-ITX
	Most desktops use E-ATX and ATX, laptops use micro and smaller
	Motherboards are classified by socket type they are compatible with
		CPU must have compatible socket
	Uses buses to transport data between components

CPU:
	The brain of computer
	Responsible for executing instructions in computer programs
	Connections laid out according to socket specification
	Core is responsible for executing instructions
		Modern computers often have more than one core
	Clock speed measures instructions per second
		4GHZ means a computer can execute 4 billion instructions per second
	Context switching allows the computer to share processor time between applications

RAM:
	Random Access Memory
	Gold connectors go into RAM slot on motherboard
	Most common way to speed up a computer is to upgrade RAM
	RAM is volatile, temporary
	Pay attention to the type of RAM and speed
		-DDR4 relatively new
		-DDR3 2007
		-Speed is measured in MHz megahurtz
		- Motherboard compatibility means less than

Storage:
	Typically a hard drive or SSD(solid state drive)
	Physical size is imporant in hard drives
		3.5 inch hard drives are frequently used in desktop computers
		2.5 inch ahrd drives used in laptops
	Drives usually have a maximum capacity slightly lower than advertised
	Mechanical hard drives contain moving parts
		-Unrealible over long periods of time
	Solid state drives have no moving parts
		-More reliable and faster
		-Significantly more expensive

GPU:
	Optional Component
	Excels at number crunching
	Does necessary calculations for displaying graphics 
	Generally resides on a graphics card
		Graphics card also has its own RAM
	Often used to crack passwords

Input Devices:
	Any device that when connected to a computer, can send date to them
	USB(universal serial bus)
		USB 3.1 Transfer Speed: 10 Gbit/s

Output Devices:
	Any device that recieves data from the computer
	EX: VGA, DVI, HDMI, and display port
		Some modern monitors support USB-C video output

Heat sinks:
	Used to move heat away from sensitive components
	Attached to components using thermal paste
	Many motherboards incorporate small heat sinks into the motherboard design

Power Supply:
	Used to take power to the main power supply or battery
	Usually connected to the motherboard, graphics card, hard drives and fans
		-Other components generally powered by motherboard
	Connectors
		- four pin peripheral connector, powers fans
		- SATA power connector, used to power hard drives
		- ATX connection, motherboard
			-motherboards use either 20 or 24 pins
		- 12V power connector, power motherboard
		-PCI-E power, graphics card
