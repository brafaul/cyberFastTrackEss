Why Privelage Escalation:
	Most of the time you gain access to a system as an unprivilged user account
	Don't always need superuser privelages. but most of the time it is helpful in achieving your goals to spread through the network
	Three sets of permissions on Linux: User, Group, and Other
	Two owners of a file: user owner and group owner
	SUID or Set User ID permission that is set on a program to say that when it is run it can run at the same privilege level as the owner of the file
	SGID or Set Group ID when the program is run it runs at the group owner's privilege level
	Can set SUID using:
		sudo chmod u+s ./demo

Exploiting Services:
	One of the best ways to privilege escalate is to find out which services are running on the box and then find exploits for them
	Start by getting a list of all running proccess using the 'ps' command

Kernel Exploits and DirtyCOW:
	Another possible way to privilege escalate is to exploit the Linux kernel itself
	First step is to find out what version of the kernel is currently running using uname -a

Wildcard Injection:
	Takes advantage of the way the Linux terminal supplies parameters to the commands it runs
	Add a file with the same name as the parameter you want to add EX: a file named '-rf'

SUID Files:
	Can find files with SUID permissions using the find command
		-4000 SUID
		-2000 GUID
	Watch for SUID programs that execute scripts you can write to
	Also watch for programs that execute scripts based on enviroment variables

Sudo:
	The command that lets a normal user run things as root if the administrator has decided they can
	Admin can determine who can run which commands as root
