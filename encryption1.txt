What is Encryption?:
	The process of converting data from one form into another, so that only the intended recipient can understand the information
	Most forms of encryption provide the following capabilites:
		Authentication: Orgin of the message can be verified
		Integrity: Proof mesage hasn't been changed
		Non-repudiation: Sender can't deny sending the message
	In order to encrypt a piece of data three things are necessary:
		1. Must have original unencrypted data
		2. Need an encryption key that will be used to encrypt the message
		3. The encryption algorithim, a mathematical function which will take in the unencrypted data and the encryption key and produce the encrypted data from that
	Three things needed to decrypt the data:
		1. Encrypted data
		2. Encryption key
		3. Encryption algorithim
	Best encryption algorithims are ones where the mathematical calculations are open to the public
	Two ways of breaking encryption:
		1. Finding a flaw in the encryption algorithim, rarely happens to mature encryption algorithims 
		2. Guess the encryption key, usually isn't feasible

Encryption vs Encoding:
	Encoding is the transformation of data from one form to another
	Encryption the transformation of data from one form to another so only the intended recipient can understand it

Symmetric Encryption:
	The simplest form of encryption there is
	The encryption key is used to encrypt the message is the same as the one used to decrypt the message
	Cesar Cipher is a form of encryption which was useb by the ancient romans where the letters of the alphabet are shifted a certain number of places
	Today we commmonly use an encryption algorithim called AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) can support encryption keys of size 128 or 256 bits
	Not worried only about key size but also how long it takes to preform the encryption algorithim, don't want too fast or too slow
	Symmetric encryption has the benefit of being faster than other forms of encryption, but suffers from a serious flaw, the problem of key exchange
		Both people need to know the encryption key, best way to tackle this is in person key exchange

Lab:
	Can encrypt message using openssl and DES algorithim:
		openssl enc -des -in fileName -out outFileName.enc
	Decrypt file using:
		openssl enc -des -d -in <filetodecrypt.enc> -out <output.file>

Asymmetric Encryption:
	Relatively new advance in the encryption world
	Every party generates two encryption keys: one private and one public
	Public encryption key is the one you send toi whoever needs to communicate with you securly
	Private key is only for you
	The two encryption keys are linked mathematically
	When someone sends a message to they encrypt their plain text with your public key, then you decrypt it using your private key
	Also known as public key cryptography
	Slow compared to symmetric encryption
	Also has problem of key exchange

Lab:
	Use RSA
	First need to generate the keypair:
		openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
	Extract public key using:
		openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
	Encrypt file using RSA:
		openssl rsautl -encrypt -in <yourfile.txt> -pubin -inkey public.pem -out <output.txt>
	Decrypt file:
	openssl rsautl -decrypt -in <cipher.txt> -inkey private.pem -out <decrypted.txt>

HTTPS:
	Uses both symmetric and asymmmetric encryption 
	Website has an SSL certificate signed by a 'certificate authority', that acts as the public key for that website
	Uses asymmmetric encryption to negotiate a symmetric key with the web server, which it then uses for the rest of the traffic

Hashing: 
	Third form of encryption, one-way encryption
	Cannot reverse the process
	Commmonly used in online login systems
	Commonly used in computer forensics to prove that evidence has not been tampered wtih

Lab:
	Can use md5sum to hash files
