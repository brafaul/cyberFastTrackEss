Exfiltration:
	Careless exfiltration attempt is a great way to catch an attacker, but requires the right countermeasures
	Pay out to how data is transmitted and the scale at which data is transmitted

HTTPS:
	Most common method of exifilitration
	Has multiple benefits:
		1.It's encrypted
		2.Very common protocol
		3.Almost always allowed out from networks
		4.Reliable
	Few ways to detect exfiltration over HTTPS:
		1. Consider where HTTPS traffic is going
		2. Set up a network device to use as a web proxy
		3. Set up a network device to use as a web proxy and enable SSL interception on it
			-Allows you to inspect HTTPS traffic

SMTP:
	Good method of exfiltration, as many people email daily
	If the mail server supports STARTTLS then the email will be encrypted in transit
	Usually allowed out through the firewall
	Especially easy when the company uses a thrid-party email provider
	In order to catch exfiltration over SMTP it is important that you inspect outbound SMTP traffic to make sure it is being made to the company SMTP servers
	Suprisingly difficult to detect

IRC:
	Internet Relay Chat: older chat protocol, strangely still used a lot in the tech community
	Sees a lot of use in malware as a command and control channel. but it's major weakness is that is such an unusual vector
	Should prevent IRC protocol from leaving a network at the firewall level
	More modern chat protocols are more difficult to stop, will have to find ways to block each protocol independenyly

DNS:
	Clever method of exfiltrating data is to use DNS queries
	Works by:
		-Attacker registers fake domain
		-Sets up a DNS server authorative for that domain
		-Malware sends data by making DNS queries against the fake domain
	Can be made even more subtle by encoding or encrypting the data before it leaves the network
	First step in detection is to log all DNS queries on the network
	Look for subdomains that look random or long and repeated queries to the same domain with different subdomains

ICMP:
	Can put data into the data field of a ping packet and send it out of the network
	Block all ICMP packets at the firewall

Sound:
	Malware can use sound at frequencies that humans cannot hear to transmit data from the air-gapped systems

The Cloud:
	Helpful in allowing attackers to cover their tracks
	Attacker can set up a server in these locations adn hide their connection amongst all the other traffic which goes out to the same datacenter
	Not much you can do about this one
