Types of Networks:
	A set of computers that are connected together
	Largest netwwork is the internet
		-The internet is a WAN(Wide Area Network)
		-Smaller networks are called LANs (Local Area Networks)
	Typically we connecy computers over a LAN using Ethernet cables or  radio signals(WiFi)
		-LAN has a router that connects to the internet
	The way a network is physically laid out is called the network 'topology'
		-Most common seen is LAN is the 'star' topology
		-This is where each computer in a network is connected to a central point, such as a switc
		-Star topology is easy to maintain
		-Another topology is the 'bus', where all computers are connected by the same Ethernet cable
		-At the end of the cable are terminator, which discard data that has not been read by a computer
		-Not very common as only one computer can communicate at any time

Network Hardware:
	A switch is a device that connects computers on a network together
		-The device that sits in the middle of a star topology
		-Recieves all data on the network and decides which cable to send the information to, based on the computer the information is destined for
	A hub is similar to a switch, except it sends all data to all computers connected to the hub
		-The computer decides if the data was intended for it or if it should discard
		-Hubs were used before switches became commonplace
		-Wireless access points(and wireless routers) are hubs
		-Wireless hubs can only send data over radio waves
	A router is a device that connects two networks together
		-Most commonly used to connect a LAN to the internet
	NIC or a Network Interface Card which allows the computer to interface with a network
		-Computers that use both wireless and ethernet have 2 NICs

IP addresses:
	Identifies your computer on a network and allows other computers on the network to access it
	Each NIC is assigned an IP address when it connects to the network
	There are two types of IP addresses, public(external) and private(internal)
	Private IP address is assigned to your computer on the local networ
	Most home and small business setups, the entire LAN will have only a single public IP address
		-The ability to share an IP address is handled by the Network Address Translation(NAT)

MAC Addresses:
	Media Access Control
	Burned into the NIC when it is produced
	Meant to be globally unique
	Used to identify computers on a local network
	Don't change like private ip addresses

Packets:
	A data packet is a unit of data, which can be transmitted over the network
	All data must be placed into packets before it can be transmitted
	Packets also contain info such as the destination IP address and MAC address
	Typically quite small pieces of data
		-Large pieces of data must be split into several packets of data
	Maximum packet size depends one several factors typically 1500 bytes - 64 KiB

Protocols:
	A set of rules that govern how two or more parties interact with each other
	Two key networking protocols, TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

TCP Protocol:
	Widely used on the internet
	Designed with the reliable delivery of data in mind
	Handshake is preformed then data is sent between computers
	Includes measures to retransmit data that was lost or corrupted
	Transmits data comparitively slow
	A port is a communication chanel for applications running on the operating system to listen to
		-Ports are numbered 0 and 65535
	TCP protocol has its own port range
		-UDP 80 and TCP 80 are different ports

UDP Protocol:
	Doesn't require a handshake
	Doesn't detect if a data packet is missing
	Commonly used in video chat, voice chat. and online video games
	Seperate from TCP ports
