Web Servers:
	Are software applications that accept and process requests according the HTTP protocol
	There are two types of web servers:
		Generic Web Servers: multi-purpose applications that serve files that are in a certain folder of an operating system
		Custom web server: programs that are purpose-built to serve a particular site
	Most popular products under the generic category are Apache and Ngnix
		Both are configured to use a folder as the 'web root': that will contain the files needed to run the website
	Generic web servers are easy to set up and require no programming knowledge
	Custom web servers, the routes are usually need to be programmed into the software
		Often used by large complex web applications as they grant more freedom than generic web server
	Typical web servers listen on either port 80(unecrypted) or 443(encrypted)

HTTP Protocol in Depth:
	Comes down to a series of requests and responses
	A HTTP response consists of two parts: the reponse header and the response body
		Header contains metadata, such as timestamp of the response, web server software that sent the repsonse and other factors
	There are several kinds or requests supported by HTTP protocol
		GET: ask to retrieve information from a specified resource
		HEAD: ask to retrieve as a specified resource, but without the response body, retrieves only the metadata without the data. Not common, used by developers to test their site
		POST: used to send data without expecting anything back	
		PUT: used to ask the web server to store the data sent in the request at the path requested. Also not common
		DELETE: deletes the resource specified in the request(if authorised), not commonly seen
	Response is split into the response header and the response body
		The body contains the data that was retrieved
		The response header contains metadata about the response

HTML: 
	Markup Language, describes data
	Uses tags
	Is static, not based on user input
	
JavaScript:
	Is a programming language designed to run inside a browser

PHP: 
	server-side programming language that generates HTML and sends it to the clients browsing the page
	Executed by the web server, result is sent as a repsonse to an HTTP request

Cookies and Local Storage:
	Cookies:
		Tiny file which a web server can create on a visitor's computer
		Most common use to to save session ID
	Local Storage:
		Sites can also store files on your computer(up to 5MB) in the browser's local storage
		Can be a sneakier way for sites to track users
