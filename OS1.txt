Operating Systems:
	Software that runs on the computer which manages how the computer operates

Kernel:
	First part of the operating system code to be loaded, and has complete control over the computer
	Responsible for controlling access to the computer's most sensitive information and functionality, and is loaded into a protected region of memory to prevent accidental or malicious corruption by other programs
	Responsible for loading new programs, handling input and output between peripherals and managing access to the hardware's shared resources, such as the RAM and hard drive

Process:
	A series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular end
	Created on a computer when a program is requested to be loaded
	Some programs create multiple proccesses

Interrupt:
	A signal that is sent to the CPU, which alerts the CPU to a task requiring its immediate attention
	Used in situations where immediate processing is required
	Hardware Interrupts: include mouse and keyboard when new input is availible
	Software Interrupts: May generate an interrypt when it wants to open a file for example, program can use an interrupt to ask the kernel to perform an operation on its behalf

Bootloader:
	Program loaded by the BIOS when a computer is first turned on and is responsible for loading the operating system
	Necessary due to the complexity that would be involved in creating a BIOS capable of loading hundreds of different operating systems
	Installed at the same time as the operating system from place on hard drive by the bios

BIOS: 
	"Basic Input Output System"
	Stored on the ROM on the motherboard of your computer
	First program that is loaded and prepares the hardware ready to load te bootloader 
	Modern computers almost exclusively use UEFI(Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)
	UEFI is succesor to BIOS, more versatile and secure manner
