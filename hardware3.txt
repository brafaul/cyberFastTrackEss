File Systems:
	Each drive must be formatted with a file system
	The file system determines how files are stored on the device and what features are offered
	OS's usually have a list of file systems that are supported
	Like a protocol for accessing files and saving files on physical storage media
	Storage device is broken down into clusters, cluster size is determined by file system
	Minimum file size is the cluster size
		-Wasted space in cluster is known as 'slack space'
	File systems store at least each two pieces of info per file
		-Data in the file
		-Metadata, usually conains at least the name and memory address of the file
	Metadata is stored in an index that provides a list of files and locations where they can be found, index entry is removed when file is deleted
	Cluster isn't removed from disk when deleted, just marked as overwritable

FAT32 and exFAT:
	Introduced with Windows 95
	Uses a File Allocation Table to map each cluster
	Doesn't support files larger than 4 GB
	Doesn't support file permissions
	exFAT is designed for USB drives and other removable media

NTFS: 
	Used by modern versions of Windows
	Has many features including permission and encryption suport, and shadow copies
	File size limit is so large it is effectively meaningless

EXT3:
	Older file system often used in Linux
	Introduced in 2001
	Supports permissions and encryption, but not shadow copy
	Maximum file size is 2TB
	Changes to disk are tracked in a seperate part of the file system known as the 'journal' 
		Can help recover drive in the event of a disk corruption

EXT4:
	Modern file system that is used in linux
	Introduced in 2008
	Supports permissions and encryption, but no shadow copy

HFS+:
	Until recently used in MAC OS X
	Supports permissions and encryption

APFS: 
	Recently introduced by Apple
	Debuted on MAC OS HIgh Sierra
