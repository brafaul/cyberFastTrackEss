Email:
	Just text sent from one email server to another and placed in your inbox
	No encryption in inbox
	Until recently there was no encryption in transit email
	Most modern email support STARTTLS, uses a similar encryption to secure HTTP
	Process of sending email:
		1. Email is created and sent
		2. Email transmitted to web server
		3. Outgoing server looks up the web server responsible for the domain you are sending the email to
		4. Outgoing server transmits the email to incoming server
		5. Incoming server looks up the email account and saves the email to the correct inbox
		6. Email client will sync with their inbox
	There are two protocols at work here the SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), and the protocol responsible for syncing the inbox(usually POP3, IMAP, or Exchange)
	Most common mail software Microsoft Exchange, Postfix, Sendmail, and Qmail

SMTP Protocol:
	Became widely used in the 1980's
	Connection oriented, text-based protocol
	Each email is called SMTP transactions
	Transactions consists of just three commands
		-MAIL: establishes return path, bounce address(where to send error message if an error occurs), send, and other things
		-RCPT: Establishes the address of the recipient
		-DATA: Signifies the start of the message text. Consists of an email header(contains metadata) and email body(contents of the email itself)

POP3:
	(Post Office Protocol 3)
	Email is stored on the server until you sync the email server
	If you have synced with email server, email will be deleted on the email server
	Downsides
		-Risk losing email if computer you download them on is lost
		-Doesn't work well across multiple devices

IMAP:
	(Internet Message Access Protocol)
	Most common protocol in use today
	Message remain on the server until the user specifically deletes them
	Tracks state of each email(read and unread)
	Also supports server side search


Microsoft Exchange: 
	Not strictly a protocol, rather server software
	Implements many different protocols
	Orginally only supported MAPI(proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft)
	Now supports IMAP, POP3, and EAS(Exchange Active Sync)
	Can't run exchange server on Linux

Email Spoofing:
	Anyone with an SMTP is capable of sending an email with any FROM address

SPF:
	Sender Policy Framework
	In the DNS configuration, you put text that list all of the IP addresses of mail servers allowed to send emails from your domain
	Problem as many people now longer host their own email, so anyone from their provider can bypass SPF

DKIM:
	Put a public key in the DNS settings for domain
	Legitimate email is signed with private key
