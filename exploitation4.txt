Exisiting Exploits:
	Usually when security researchers find an exploit in software, they will follow a process known as responsible disclosure
		-First the researcher will reach out to the company in question and inform them of their finding
		-They then work togethor to create a timeline they both feel is reasonable for when a patch is released
		-After the patch is released, the researcher will disclose the bug
	exploit-db.com is an excellent resource for finding exploits

Exploiting a Real FTP Service:
	Can use msfvenom to generate shellcode for buffer overflows
		-a specifies the architecure of the target
		-p specifies the payload
		-b specifies bad character
			0x00 is null
			0x0d is carriage return 
			0x0a is the newline character
		--platform specfies the platform the target is running on

Exploiting a Web Service:
	First step is to find out which version of the software is running
		-If the software that is running doesn't tell us, you can just download several versions of the software and look at the HTML and JavaScript to match up the version numbers

Metasploit:
	Used heavily in the security industry
	Steps:
		1. Load up the metasploit framework
		2. Choose the exploit you want to use from their list of exploits
		3. Choos ethe payload you want to deliver
		4. Configure the exploit and payload
		5. Run the exploit
